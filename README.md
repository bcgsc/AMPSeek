Anti-microbial property, protein structure and toxicity detection from peptide sequences

## Introduction
Microbes developing resistace to the current drugs, Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) has become a global threat, even one of the biggest of public health and development problems, according to World Health Organization [[1](#references)]. In 2019, almost 5 million deaths related to bacterial AMR worldwide were documented. [[2](#references)]. Moreover, the issue extends beyond health, significantly impacting the global economic balance as well. 
The World Bank estimates global Gross Domestic Product to decrease by 1.1% percent if AMR is still a part of our lives by 2050 [[3](#references)]. This effect is equivalent with the outcome of the Great Recession [[3](#references)]. Luckily, this is an area for proteomics and bioinformatics and scientific community tries to obtain reliable drugs instead of current ones.
